# Password Strength Analyzer (Web)

A simple, user-friendly **Password Strength Analyzer** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It checks a password in real-time and shows whether it's **Weak**, **Medium**, or **Strong** based on length and character variety.

## Demo
Open `index.html` in any modern browser to try it locally.  
(Or view it on GitHub Pages if deployed.)

## Features
- Real-time password strength feedback as the user types
- Checks for:
  - Minimum length (≥ 8)
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Simple, responsive UI with color-coded strength indicator

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How to run (Local)
1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/my-project.git
my-project/
├─ index.html
├─ style.css
├─ script.js
└─ README.md
How it works (simple)

index.html contains an input field for the password and a div to show strength.

script.js listens for input events and evaluates the password using regex checks.

Based on a score (0–5), the script sets the strength label and applies a CSS class (weak, medium, strong) that colors the text.

Possible improvements (ideas)

Show a strength meter (visual bar) with percentages.

Provide suggestions (e.g., "Add a special character" or "Make it longer").

Add a password generator that creates strong passwords.

Save anonymized stats locally (how many passwords are weak/strong) — for demo only.

Add accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes) and keyboard support.

Add unit tests for the JS logic.

### Quick checklist (optional things to add to the repo)
- ✅ `README.md` (use above)
- ✅ `LICENSE` (e.g., MIT) — add if you want to allow reuse
- ✅ `.gitignore` (if you add any build files later)
- 🖼️ `screenshot.png` — add a screenshot and reference it in README (e.g., `![screenshot](screenshot.png)`)
- 🌐 Deploy via **GitHub Pages** and add the link to README under Demo
- ✨ Small GIF showing live typing (nice-to-have for portfolio)

Want me to:
- Create a screenshot example markdown line for your README?
- Add a small piece of JS that shows suggestions (e.g., “Add a number”)?
- Or generate a ready `LICENSE` (MIT) file to paste in?

Tell me which and I’ll add it right away. 😊
